This article is written by a Software Engineer at Google and focuses on the future of the software engineering career in relation to advancements in AI. It addresses five main questions and presents two contrasting scenarios for each, helping readers prepare for different possible outcomes. I found this especially relevant given my current stage of early career preparation. In particular, the “what to do about it” sections for each question were useful to keep in mind as I continue progressing in the field, as they provide advice for current students and recent graduates on how to transition effectively.

The question that interested me the most was the junior developer question: will junior developer hiring collapse as AI automates entry-level tasks, or rebound as software spreads into every industry? The author discusses the first scenario, in which junior developer roles may decline as companies increasingly rely on AI for entry-level functions. The article also raises the possibility that junior developer roles could pivot toward building and maintaining automations for specific niches.
